Website Description & Theme
Description: The Preventive Healthcare Guide is a multi-page, responsive website designed to educate users on proactive health management. It features an interactive Service Page using dynamic flexbox cards, a structured Healthcare Tips table for habit tracking, and a functional Contact Form for user inquiries. The site is built using a clean "Flat Architecture" to ensure fast loading and easy navigation across Home, About, Tips, and Contact sections.

Theme:

Color Palette: The design utilizes a Professional Teal & Aqua scheme (#1e8a8a, #146666). These colors were specifically chosen to evoke feelings of health, cleanliness, and medical trust.

Typography: It uses a clean, Sans-Serif (Arial) font style to prioritize readability and a modern aesthetic.

User Interface (UI): The theme focuses on Minimalism, using rounded corners, subtle box shadows, and hover transitions to create a soft, approachable feel for healthcare information.

Imagery: High-quality Hero Images and icons provide visual context to the health topics, ensuring the site is engaging rather than just text-heavy.
